'''
    This class provides the easiest way to add your own networks to APT. To add your networks, if your network name is _mynet_, you'll have to create a new file Pose_mynet.py in which you need to define a new class of the same name (Pose_mynet) which should inherit from PoseBase.
    ```
    from PoseBase import PoseBase
    class Pose_mynet(PoseBase):
        def train(self):
        ...
    ```

    If the network generates heatmaps for each landmark (i.e., body part), then you need to override

    * `PoseBase.PoseBase.create_network`:
    * Supply the appropriate hmaps_downsample to the __init__ function when you inherit. Eg, self.hmaps_downsample = 8

    If your networks output is different than only heatmaps, you'll have to override

    * `PoseBase.PoseBase.preproc_func`: (to generate the target outputs other than heatmaps).
    * `PoseBase.PoseBase.create_network`:
    * `PoseBase.PoseBase.loss`:
    * `PoseBase.PoseBase.convert_preds_to_locs`:

    In addition, if you want to change the training procedure, you'll have to override

    * `PoseBase.PoseBase.train` function:
    * `PoseBase.PoseBase.get_pred_fn` function:

    To use pretrained weights, put the location of the pretrained weights in self.pretrained_weights. Eg
    ``` def __init__(self, conf):
            ...
            script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
            wt_dir = os.path.join(script_dir, 'pretrained')
            self.pretrained_weights =  os.path.join(wt_dir,'resnet_v1_50.ckpt')
    ```

    The Pose_mynet object once created, will have access to configuration settings that were set by the user in APT GUI in the self.conf object. Some of the useful configuration settings are:

    * imsz: 2 element tuple specifying the size of the input image.
    * img_dim: Number of channels in input image.
    * batch_size: Batch size defined by user.
    * rescale: How much to downsample the input image before feeding into the network.
    * dl_steps: Number of steps to run training for.
    Details of other settings can be found APT/tracker/dt/params_deeptrack.yaml.

        This function trains the network my minimizing the loss function using Adam optimizer along with gradient norm clipping.
        The learning rate schedule is exponential decay: lr = conf.learning_rate*(conf.gamma**(float(cur_step)/conf.decay_steps))
        Override this function to implement a different training function. If you override this, do override the get_pred_fn as well.
        For saving the models, call self.create_saver() after creating the network but before creating a session to setup the saver. Call self.save(sess, step_no)  every self.conf.save_step to save intermediate models. At the end of training, again call self.save(sess, self.conf.dl_steps) to save the final model. During prediction (get_pred_fn), you can restore the latest model by calling self.create_saver() after creating the network but before creating a session, and then calling self.restore(sess). In most cases, if you use self.create_saver(), then you don't need to override get_pred_fn().
        If you want to use your own saver, the train function should save models to self.conf.cachedir every self.conf.save_step. Also save a final model at the end of the training with step number self.conf.dl_steps. APT expects the model files to be named 'deepnet-<step_no>' (i.e., follow the format used by tf.train.Saver for saving models e.g. deepnet-10000.index). If you write your own saver, then you'll have to override get_pred_fn() for restoring the model.
        Before each training step call self.fd_train() which will setup the data generator to generate augmented input images in self.inputs from training database during the next call to sess.run. This also sets the self.ph['phase_train'] to True for batch norm. Use self.fd_val() will generate non-augmented inputs from training DB and to set the self.ph['phase_train'] to false for batch norm.
        To view updated training status in APT, call self.update_and_save_td(step,sess) after each training step. Note update_and_save_td uses the output of loss function to find the loss and convert_preds_to_locs function to find the distance between prediction and labeled locations.
