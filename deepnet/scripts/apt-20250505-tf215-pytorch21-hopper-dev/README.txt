This is the "development" version of the
apt-20250505-tf215-pytorch21-hopper environment.  The environment.yml
was created by some amount of trial-and-error to get a working conda
environment for APT that would work on hopper architectures GPUs.

Once it was all set and working, the final locked version was created
along the lines described in

../apt-20250505-tf215-pytorch21-hopper/README.txt
