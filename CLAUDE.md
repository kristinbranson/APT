- This project is APT, the Animal Part Tracker.  It is partly in Matlab, partly in Python.  It is launched by calling StartAPT() in Matlab.
- Test functions are kept under matlab/test/single-tests.  A single test is a Matlab function that errors if the test fails and exits normally if the test passes.  APT supports four different 'backends' for doing deep learning: aws, bsub, conda, and docker.  An APT 'project' is stored in a .lbl file, and consists of paths to movies and ground-truth labeling data for some of the movies.  Projects using the conda and docker backend do deep network training and evaluation on the local machine.  Projects using the aws and bsub backends do training and evaluation on a remote machine.  Tests that use the (local) conda and docker backends go in matlab/test/single-tests, tests the use the (remote) aws and bsub backends go in matlab/test/single-tests/remote.
- On Matlab launch, you can set up the path for running APT by doing `modpath();` at the Matlab command line.
- To run the baseline test suite, you call the function `test_apt()` in Matlab.  This only exercises the local backends.
