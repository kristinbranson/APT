<br/>

<p>The <b>Animal Part Tracker</b> (<b>APT</b>) is machine learning software for automatically tracking the locations of body parts in input videos. For example, it has been used to track the tips of the legs of a fly or the ears of a mouse. To train a tracker, a user labels the locations of selected landmark points in selected frames and videos. Machine learning is then used to train a classifier which can automatically predict the locations of these parts in new frames and videos.</p>

<p>APT is modular software that has been engineered to work efficiently for a variety of applications. It has been used to track parts of flies, mice, and larvae. It can track parts in two dimensions from video from a single camera, or in three dimensions from video from multiple calibrated cameras. It can also be used to track the parts of multiple interacting animals. APT includes both an engineered labeling interface as well as machine learning algorithms for training trackers.</p>

<p>APT is developed by Allen Lee, Mayank Kabra, Alice Robie, Stephen Huston, Felipe Rodriguez, Roian Egnor, Austin Edwards, and Kristin Branson. All work is funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Janelia Research Campus.</p>

<h2><a id="Requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

<h3>MATLAB</h3>

<p>APT works best with <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> version >= 2020a and the following MATLAB toolboxes:
<ul>
<li>Image Processing Toolbox</li>
<li>Parallel Computing Toolbox</li>
<li>Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox</li>
<li>Curve Fitting Toolbox (<i>Multi-camera only</i>)</li>
<li>Computer Vision System Toolbox (<i>Multi-camera only</i>)</li>
<li>Optimization Toolbox (<i>Multi-camera only</i>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>At the present time (June 2025), we do <em>not</em> recommend using Matlab 2025a or later with APT.  Matlab 2025a switched to a new GUI architecture, and this has caused various issues with APT that have not been fully addressed yet.  We hope to offer full 2025a support in the near future.</p>

<h3>GPU</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">CUDA-enabled</a> <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/best-gpu-tensorflow-2080-ti-vs-v100-vs-titan-v-vs-1080-ti-benchmark">GPU</a> is required to train a deep-learning based tracker. This GPU can be:
<ul>
<li>On your local machine.</li>
<li>On the Amazon Cloud (AWS).</li>
<li>On the Janelia GPU cluster (Janelians-only).</li>
</ul>
We refer to this as the <a href="#BackEnd"><b>back end</b></a>, and more information about setting up each of these back ends is <a href="#BackEnd">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you choose to use a <b>local back end</b>, your local machine must have an NVIDIA GPU with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported">Compute Capability >= 3.0</a>. The best GPUs for deep learning are constantly changing (some benchmark info is <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/tag/benchmarks/">here</a>). It is important for this GPU to have sufficient memory. All GPUs we have used have at least 12GB of RAM. In our lab, we have used the following GPUs:
<ul>
<li>V100</li>
<li>2080 Ti</li>
<li>Titan Xp (older)</li>
<li>Titan X (older)</li>
<li>1080 Ti (older)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="How to">How to train a part tracker with machine learning</a></h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>APT uses machine learning to estimate the positions in each video frame of multiple specified animal parts. For example, a <b>part</b> could be the tip of the tarsus of the left front leg of a fly, or the base of a mouse's tail.</p>
<p>To train APT, you must label the locations of these parts in many sample images. The collection of video frames and corresponding manual labels is called the <b>training data set</b>. </p>
<p>APT's machine learning algorithm will then learn a classifier which can <b>predict</b> part locations from just the video frame. It chooses the parameters of the classifier so that it is as accurate as possible on the training data. </p>
<p>This learned classifier can then be used to track frames, animals, and videos that it wasn't trained on, producing <b>trajectories</b> -- the locations of each part for each animal over sequences of frames.</p>
<p>APT gives you a lot of freedom -- you must choose which parts to label and which frames, videos, and animals to include in your training data. You can also choose different machine learning algorithms, each of which include multiple hyperparameters that can affect their performance. Below, we outline some principles to consider to get APT to work well.</p>
<h3><a id="#Which parts">Which parts should you label?</a></h3>
<p>The first choice you must make is which parts you want to label. The first thing to consider is <b>what you are going to do with the output trajectories</b>, should tracking be successful. We try to think through the exact computations we will do with the output trajectories before deciding which parts to label. </p>
<p>The second thing to consider is how <b>reliably</b> you can manually label each part. That is, if you were to ask two people to label the part in the same image, how much <b>inter-annotator disagreement</b> will there be? As a rule of thumb, if it is hard for you to do the task, it will be also be hard for APT. We have found it easier to label parts that correspond to specific anatomical locations on the animal regardless of what angle you are viewing the animal from. For example, the tip of a mouse's left ear is a specific anatomical location, while the top of the mouse's head might be a more view-dependent feature. </p>
<p>It is also important to consider <b>how easy it is</b> to identify that specific anatomical location from images. For example, the left front shoulder joint of a mouse is a specific anatomical location, but it is quite difficult to localize visually through all the blobbiness of a mouse. It is also important to think about how easy it is to localize the part from the types of video you have recorded. For instance, it is perhaps hard to label the big toe of the front left foot of a mouse in video taken from above a mouse, since the foot is <b>often occluded</b> by the body of the mouse. It is best if you do not need to guess where the part is, but can reliably localize the part.</p>

  <i>Example part choices for a variety of tracking projects</i>
</center>
<h3><a id="Which frames">Training data: Which frames should you label?</a></h3>
<p>Using APT, you can choose to label whichever frames you like. Here, we describe some best practices for choosing frames to label.</p>
<p>Choose a <b>diverse set of frames</b> to label that are <b>representative</b> of all the types of videos you want your tracker to work on. If you want your tracker to work on many different animals, then you should <b>label different animals</b>, otherwise your tracker may overfit to specific characteristics of the one individual you labeled. Similarly, if you want your tracker to work in many different videos, then you should <b>label frames in multiple videos</b>, otherwise the tracker may overfit to specific characteristics of individual videos.</p>
<p>In general, you want to think about all the different ways you might want to use the tracker, and make sure that all of those are represented in your training data. APT makes it easy to add multiple videos to your <a href="#APT Projects">APT Project</a> and to navigate to different frames and different animals.</p>
<p>You should label frames in which the animal is in a variety of <b>different poses</b>. Labeling multiple really similar looking frames may not be very helpful. This is because each really similar frame does not provide much extra information beyond the original. A particular case of this are frames that are temporally near each other, e.g. frame 1 and frame 2 of a video, which will look very similar. </p>
<p>If you <b>only have a few animals</b> in your experiments, then it is feasible to include training examples from all of them, and we recommend doing this. Similarly, if you <b>only have a few videos</b> that you want your tracker to run on, then it is feasible to include training examples from all of them, and we recommend doing this. Otherwise, you will want your tracker to generalize to animals and/or videos you did not train on, so you should <b>train on enough different animals/videos that APT can learn all the ways that animals/videos can differ from each other</b> -- it must <b>learn what properties of animals/videos it should ignore</b>.</p>
<h3><a id="How many frames">How many frames do I need to label?</a></h3>
<p>The number of frames you need to label depends on many things, including how hard the task is. We believe that the best way to tell if you have labeled enough frames is to <b>train a tracker</b> and then <b>evaluate how well it is working</b>.</p>
<h3><a id="Is it working">How do I tell if it is working?</a></h3>
<p>To tell if your tracker is working, you need to <b>test it on video sequences representative of those you want to use it on</b>. It is important to devise a good set of test videos that <b>represent how you plan on using your tracker</b>. In particular, it is important that the test video sequences be <b>as different from your training data</b> as the videos you ultimately want to use the tracker on. The tracker will <b>overfit to the training data</b>, and will likely perform close to perfectly on frames in your training data set, and it will likely also overfit to examples very similar to your training examples. So, since temporally adjacent frames are very similar, your tracker will likely work better on frames temporally near training frames. </p>
<p>If you want to use your tracker on videos that you did not train it on, then it is important to test it on <b>videos from which you haven't included any training data</b>. Similarly, if you want it to work on animals that you did not train it on, then you should test it on <b>animals you didn't train it on</b>. If you are evaluating on animals and videos that you trained on, then you should select frames temporally far from training frames for evaluation. </p>
<p>APT makes it easy to train a tracker then predict on a sequence of frames. The first test of whether the tracker is working is the <b>eye-ball test</b> -- just look at the predictions and see if, by eye, they look accurate. If it is easy to find frames that the tracker is performing poorly on, then we recommend annotating these frames, adding them to the training set, and re-training. </p>
<p>Once APT has passed the eye-ball test, you can use <a href="#Cross Validation">cross-validation</a> to estimate accuracy quantitatively. The gold standard for accuracy estimation is <a href="#Groundtruthing">ground truthing</a>, in which you manually annotate new frames, and quantitatively compare APT's predictions to manual labels.</p>
<h3>How do I set tracking parameters?</h3>
<p>Before you click the Train button, there are some parameters that are important to set. You can select the <a href="#Algorithm">tracking algorithm</a> from the Track->Tracking algorithm menu. You can select the backend on which all GPU computations will be performed from the <a href="#BackEnd">Track->GPU/Backend Configuration</a> menu. Parameters related to the currently selected algorithm can be set from the Tracking Parameters GUI, accessed from the <a href="#Tracking parameters">Track -> Configure tracking parameters</a> menu. For each new application, it is important that you set the Tracking Parameters labeled as <b>Important</b>. Information on tracking parameters is <a href="#Tracking parameters">here</a>.</p>

      <i>Example APT project categories</i></center><br/>


<p>APT can be used to track a wide variety of different configurations. The following important distinctions are made:
  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="images/SingleVsMultiAnimal.png" id="Multitarget">Single animal or multi-animal videos?</a></b>
      Does each video contain exactly one animal, or does it contain multiple animals? Currently, <a href="#Body tracking">body-tracking</a> pre-processing is necessary for multi-animal tracking.
      <center><br/><a href="images/MultiTargetBodyTrackingInterface.png"><img src="images/MultiTargetBodyTrackingInterface.png" width="50%"></a><br/>
      <i>Screenshot of APT interface for multi-animal tracking with body tracking</i></center><br/>
    </li>
    <li><b><a id="Body tracking">Body tracking available?</a></b> It can be helpful to pre-process the video using a body-tracking algorithm, which <b>tracks the centroid and/or orientation of each animal</b> in the video. There are many body-tracking algorithms free to download, for example <a href="http://ctrax.sourceforge.net/">Ctrax</a>, <a href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Tools/FlyTracker/">FlyTracker</a>, <a href="https://idtracker.ai/en/latest/">idtracker</a>, and <a href="http://motr.janelia.org/">motr</a>. When body tracking is available, APT can crop a box around the localized animal and only search for parts in this box. Body tracking is currently <b>required for multi-animal part tracking</b>. It is important when video frames are high resolution and each animal fills only a small region of the frame, e.g. when an animal is freely moving in a large arena. This is because deep learning algorithms are <b>memory limited</b>, and images either need to be cropped based on body tracking or downsampled, which can cause loss of tracking resolution. Finally, if body orientation tracking is available and reliable, the <b>cropped images can be aligned according to this orientation</b>, simplifying the part tracking problem.

<h2><a id="Labeling parts">Labeling training data</a></h2>

<p>One of the main goals of the APT user interface is allowing easy and efficient labeling of training data. To this end, we have implemented a few different labeling modes. You can select different labeling modes from the <b>Label</b> menu.</p>

<h3><a id="Sequential mode">Sequential labeling mode</a></h3>
<p>In sequential labeling mode, when you decide to label an animal and frame, you must click and label all points in sequential order. We recommend using this mode if you have <b>memorized the part order</b> (you can look at the <a href="#Reference frame">reference frame</a> for a reminder) and most of the parts are in quite variable locations. <b>We use this mode for almost all of our projects.</b></p>
<p>To begin labeling an animal/frame, <b>click on the location of part 1</b> in the <a href="#Labeling window">labeling window</a>. Then, <b>sequentially click</b> to label parts 2, 3, ... until you have <b>labeled all parts</b>.</p>
<p>You can <b>edit placement</b> of any landmark after you finish initially positioning all parts in the following ways:
  <ul>
    <li>Clicking and <b>dragging</b> the part.</li>
    <li>Selecting a point by <b>typing its identifying number</b>. Initially, parts 1-10 correspond to keys 1-9,0. Typing a <b>`(back quote)</b> will toggle to access the next 10 landmark points, i.e. 11-20 correspond to 1-9,0. You can type `(back quote) again to toggle back to 1-10. The mapping is indicated in green on the left side of the <a href="#GUI">GUI</a>. You can tell that a part has been selected because its <b>marker will change from a '+' to an 'x'</b>. After a part is selected, you can <b>click a new location</b> to move the part to that location. Alternatively, you can use the <b>arrow keys</b>. Re-typing the identifying number will toggle the part to be <b>unselected</b> again. </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>You can <b>remove labels</b> from the current animal and frame by clicking the <b><a href="#Clear button">Clear</a></b> button.</p>
<p>If you change frames in the middle of labeling a frame, the locations of the parts you have clicked so far will be <b>lost</b>. To see temporal context in the middle of labeling, you can click the <a href="#GUI"><b>Play context</b></a> button. </p>
<p>To label that a part is <a href="#Occluded"><b>occluded</b></a>, hold down the <b>shift</b> key while clicking. Alternatively, you can select the point and type 'o'. Occluded points are indicated with an 'o' marker. </p>

<h3><a id="Template mode">Template labeling mode</a></h3>
<p>In template mode, all the parts are placed in a pre-specified location, and you select and move individual parts. This mode is useful if it is hard to remember the parts in order (e.g. if there are a <i>lot</i> of parts), or if many of the parts don't move much. </p>

<p>When you navigate to an unlabeled frame, all the parts will appear as white '+'es. As you modify them, they will be colored.</p>

<p>The <b>initial locations</b> of the parts in a given frame is based on the last labeled frame you have navigated to. If you have <a href="#Body Tracking">body tracking</a>, then the template will translate and/or rotate with the body track. If no frames have been labeled yet, the initial part locations will be random.</p>
<p>You can <b>modify</b> the label of any part in the following ways:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Clicking</b> a part to select it. You can tell that a part has been selected because its <b>marker will change from a '+' to an 'x'</b>. After a part is selected, you can <b>click a new location</b> to move the part to that location. Alternatively, you can use the <b>arrow keys</b>. </li>
    <li>Clicking and <b>dragging</b> the part.</li>
    <li>Selecting a point by <b>typing its identifying number</b>. Initially, parts 1-10 correspond to keys 1-9,0. Typing a <b>`(back quote)</b> will toggle to access the next 10 landmark points, i.e. 11-20 correspond to 1-9,0. You can type `(back quote) again to toggle back to 1-10. The mapping is indicated in green on the left side of the <a href="#GUI">GUI</a>. After a part is selected, you can <b>click a new location</b> to move the part to that location. Alternatively, you can use the <b>arrow keys</b>. Re-typing the identifying number will toggle the part to be <b>unselected</b> again. </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Once you have <b>finished labeling</b> the animal and frame, <b>click the red <a href="#Label state button">"Accept"</a></b> button to let APT know that this frame is now completely labeled. You can also press the keyboard shortcut 's' or the space bar. The Accept button will change to green and read "Labeled". All parts will change to be colored '+'es. </p>
<p>You can <b>remove labels</b> from the current animal and frame by clicking the <b><a href="#Clear button">Clear</a></b> button. The green <a href="#Label state button">"Labeled"</a> button will change back to a red "Accept" button. </p>
<p>If you change frames in the middle of labeling a frame, the locations of the parts you have clicked so far will be <b>lost</b>. To see temporal context in the middle of labeling, you can click the <a href="#GUI"><b>Play context</b></a> button. </p>
<p>To label that a part is <a href="#Occluded"><b>occluded</b></a>, hold down the <b>shift</b> key while clicking. Alternatively, you can select the point and type 'o'. Occluded points are indicated with an 'o' marker. </p>

<!-- <li><b>High throughput mode:</b><br>

In HT mode, you label the entire movie for point 1, then you label the entire movie for point 2, etc. Click the image to label a point. After clicking/labeling, the movie is automatically advanced. The number of frames to advance is set in 'Set Frame Increment' in the Label dropdown menu. When the end of the movie is reached, the labeling point is incremented, until all labeling for all points is complete. You may manually change the current labeling point in 'Set Labeling Point' in the Label dropdown menu.

Right-clicking the current point offers options for repeatedly accepting the current point. Right-clicking the image labels a point as an "occluded estimate", ie the clicked location represents your best guess at an occluded landmark.

<h3><a id="Multiview mode">Multiview labeling mode</a></h3>

<p><a href="#MultiView">Multi-view</a> projects require parts to be labeled in each view. There is an extra <a href="#Label frame">label frame</a> for each additional view. Multiview labeling mode must be used for all multi-view projects. </p>

<p>Multi-view labeling mode is most similar to <a href="#Template mode">template labeling mode</a>. When you navigate to an unlabeled frame, all the parts are placed in a pre-specified location in all views, and will appear as white '+'es. As you modify them, they will be colored. When a part is selected for modification, it is <b>selected in all views</b> simultaneously. </p>

<p>The <b>initial locations</b> of the parts in a given frame is based on the last labeled frame you have navigated to. If no frames have been labeled yet, the initial part locations will be random.</p>
<p>You can <b>modify</b> the label of any part in the following ways:
  <ul>
    <li>If no other part is selected, you can <b>click</b> a part to select it. You can tell that a part has been selected because its number will be bolded and surrounded by a <b>white rectangle</b>. After a part is selected, you can <b>click a new location</b> to move the part to that location. Note that you can click in any view to modify the label in that view. </li>
    <li>If no other part is selected, you can click and <b>drag</b> the part to a new location.</li>
    <li>You can selecting a point by <b>typing its identifying number</b>. Initially, parts 1-10 correspond to keys 1-9,0. Typing a <b>`(back quote)</b> will toggle to access the next 10 landmark points, i.e. 11-20 correspond to 1-9,0. You can type `(back quote) again to toggle back to 1-10. The mapping is indicated in green on the left side of the <a href="#GUI">GUI</a>. You can then <b>click a new location</b> to move the part to that location. Alternatively, you can use the <b>arrow keys</b> to move the part in the currently in-focus view. Re-typing the identifying number or the space bar will toggle the part to be <b>unselected</b> again. </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Once you have <b>finished labeling</b> the animal and frame, <b>click the red <a href="#Label state button">"Accept"</a></b> button to let APT know that this frame is now completely labeled. You can also press the keyboard shortcut 's' or the space bar. The Accept button will change to green and read "Labeled". All parts will change to be colored '+'es. </p>
<p>You can <b>remove labels</b> from the current animal and frame by clicking the <b><a href="#Clear button">Clear</a></b> button. The green <a href="#Label state button">"Labeled"</a> button will change back to a red "Accept" button. </p>
<p>If your cameras are <b>calibrated</b>, you can load this calibration information into APT by selecting <a id="Load calibration file"><b>Load calibration file</b></a> from the <b>Label</b> menu. Calibration file types are detailed <a href="#Calibration files">here</a>. When a part is selected in one view by clicking on it, the calibration information is used to compute the <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/OWENS/LECT10/node3.html">epipolar line</a> on which the part in other views should lie.

<h3><a id="Multiview streamlined mode">Streamlined multiview labeling mode</a></h3>

<p>The <b>streamlined</b> version of multiview labeling is very similar to standard <a href="Multiview mode">multiview labeling mode</a>, with a few features to reduce the number of clicks necessary. Streamlined mode can be selected by choosing <b>"Streamlined"</b> from the Label menu.</p>

<p>The main <b>differences</b> from standard multiview labeling are the following:
  <ul>
    <li><b>No template is shown</b> when you navigate to an unlabeled frame. Instead, you must <b>select a part by typing its identifying number</b>.</li>
    <li>Once all parts have been annotated in all views, the label for the frame is <b>automatically accepted</b> -- you do not need to click the <b>"Accept"</b> button.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<!--
<p>A full description of multiview streamlined mode follows.</p>


<p>When you navigate to an <b>unlabeled frame</b>, no parts will be shown. To being annotating, type <b>type the identifying number</b> for the part you want to label. Initially, parts 1-10 correspond to keys 1-9,0. Typing a <b>`(back quote)</b> will toggle to access the next 10 landmark points, i.e. 11-20 correspond to 1-9,0. You can type `(back quote) again to toggle back to 1-10. The mapping is indicated in green on the left side of the <a href="#GUI">GUI</a>. </p>

<p>Click the location of the part in <b>each view</b>. Clicking again in the view will move the part to the selected view. You can also modify the location of the part by <b>clicking and dragging</b> the part, or by using the <b>arrow keys</b>. </p>

<p>Then, <b>type the identifying number</b> for the next part you want to label, and repeat, until you have labeled all parts in the frame. </p>

<p>At any time, you can <b>modify</b> a part's annotation by typing its identifying number, and clicking, dragging, or using the arrow keys. You can tell that a part has been selected because its number will be bolded and surrounded by a <b>white rectangle</b>.

<p>Once all parts have been annotated in all views, the <a href="#Label state button">label state button</a> automatically toggles to <b>"Accepted"</b>. 

<p>You can <b>remove labels</b> from the current animal and frame by clicking the <b><a href="#Clear button">Clear</a></b> button. The green <a href="#Label state button">"Labeled"</a> button will change back to a red "Accept" button. </p>

<h2><a id="Body tracking requirements">Body-tracking project requirements</a></h2>

<p>As described <a href="#Body tracking">above</a>, APT can use <b>trajectories</b> indicating the centroid and/or orientation of each animal in each frame to preprocess the videos. These trajectories are computed using other tracking software, and are stored in <b>MAT files</b>, <a href="#Manage Movies">one for each video</a>. </p>

<h3><a id="Trx file format">Trx file format</a></h3>
<p>APT expects body tracking data in the trx file format which is a MATLAB .mat file containing a variable <b><code>trx</code></b>. <code>trx</code> is an array of structs with an element for each animal (i.e., <code>length(trx)</code> is the number of animals/trajectories in the video). The struct for each trajectory <code>i</code>, <code>trx(i)</code>, has the following fields:
  <ul>
    <li><code>x</code>: x-coordinate of the animal in pixels (1 x <code>nframes</code>). Thus, <code>trx(i).x(t)</code> is the x-position of animal <code>i</code> in frame <code>t</code> of the animal's trajectory (which corresponds to video frame <code>trx(i).firstframe + t - 1</code>).</li>
    <li><code>y</code>: y-coordinate of the animal in pixels (1 x <code>nframes</code>).</li>
    <li><code>theta</code>: Orientation of the animal (head) in radians (1 x <code>nframes</code>).</li>
    <li><code>a</code>: 1/4 of the major-axis length in pixels (1 x <code>nframes</code>).</li>
    <li><code>b</code>: 1/4 of the minor-axis length in pixels (1 x <code>nframes</code>).</li>
    <li><code>nframes</code>: Number of frames in the trajectory of the current animal (scalar).</li>
    <li><code>firstframe</code>: First frame of the animal's trajectory (scalar).</li>
    <li><code>endframe</code>: Last frame of the animal's trajectory (scalar).</li>
    <li><code>off</code>: Offset for computing index into x, y, etc. Always equal to <code>1 - firstframe</code> (scalar).
  </ul>
</p>
<p>If your tracker does not track the orientation (<code>theta</code>), the major-axis length (<code>a</code>) or the minor axis length (<code>b</code>), set these values to <code>NaN</code>.</p>
<!--In these cases: (theta missing) theta alignment, and (theta,a,b missing) Neighbor Masking can not be used.-->

<p>Below is the <code>trx</code> struct for a movie with 1500 frames and two animals. The first trajectory has data for the entire movie. The second trajectory is tracked for the second half of the movie (frames 750:1500).</p>

<h3><a id="Body tracking cropping">Body-tracking-based image cropping</a></h3>

<p>APT uses body tracking information to crop and/or rotate the image around the tracked animals and improve tracking performance. For each body trajectory in each frame, APT crops a square centered at the body tracking centroid (<code>trx(i).x(t),trx(i).y(t)</code> above). The width of this square is defined as twice the <b>ImageProcessing:Body Tracking:Target ROI:Radius</b> parameter. The square can also be rotated according to be aligned with the animal's body orientation (<code>trx(i).theta(t)</code> above). This is particularly important when recording video from <b>overhead</b>, as we want APT to track in the same way regardless of which direction the animal is facing. To rotate the crop based on orientation, select the parameter <b>ImageProcessing:Body Tracking:Target ROI:Align using trajectory theta</b>.</p>

<p>These transformations can improve tracking in a few ways:
  <ul>
    <li>Cropping reduces the size of the image the tracker searches over and operates on. We have found this to be very important because deep learning algorithms are <b>memory limited</b>, and images either need to be cropped based on body tracking or downsampled, which can cause loss of tracking resolution. Note that APT can also crop around a static location, see <a href="#Cropping">Cropping movies</a>. </li>
    <li>Centering the cropped image on a single animal is also essential for tracking individuals in videos containing <b>multiple animals</b>. </li>
    <li>For overhead views of animals, by aligning with the body orientation, APT can be <b>invariant</b> to the animal's orientation in the environment -- the tracker can operate the same regardless of which direction the animal is facing. Otherwise, APT must learn to identify the orientation of the animal, and that this orientation should not affect tracking.</li>
  </ul>

<p>If a <a href="#Setting up a new project">project is set up</a> to have <b><var>N</var> > 1 views</b>, then videos are <a href="#AddMovie">added</a> to the project as sets of <var>N</var>.</p>
<p>Frames in these videos should be <b>synchronized</b> -- e.g. frame 123 in video 1 should have been recorded at the same time as frame 123 in video 2.

<h3><a id="Configure tracking parameters">Configure tracking parameters</a></h3>

<p>APT's performance depends critically on setting several tracking parameters well. Several of these parameters must be changed with each new tracking application. To access the tracking parameters, select <b>"Configure tracking parameters..."</b> from the Tracking menu.</p>

<center><a id="TrackingParametersGUI" href="images/TrackingParametersGUI.png"><img src="images/TrackingParametersGUI.png"></a></center>

<p>We have divided parameters into the following categories:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Important</b>: These parameters should be adjusted <b>with each new tracking application</b>. </li>
    <li><b>Beginner</b>: We recommend that <b>everyone</b> consider and adjust these parameters. They may not need to be changed from one application to another. </li>
    <li><b>Advanced</b>: We recommend these parameters be modified only by advanced users, or with help from developers.</li>
    <li><b>Developer</b>: We don't recommend modifying these parameters. They may be works-in-progress or obsolete. </li>
  </ul>
  At the bottom of the GUI, you can select which of these parameters to show. In the example above, we select "Beginner", which limits parameters made visible to Important and Beginner. Once you have set the parameters to what you would like, hit the Apply button. </p>
</p>

<p>Next, we describe our process for setting parameters for a new project. We also provide a table with values chosen for a variety of applications.</p>

<h3><a id="Deep learning parameter guide">Guide to setting tracking parameters: deep learning</a></h3>
  
<h4>1. Set cropping parameters.</h4>

<p>For <b><a href="#Body tracking">Body tracking projects</a></b>, <a href="#Body tracking cropping">cropping</a> parameters are accessed within the <a href="#TrackingParametersGUI">"Tracking parameters" GUI</a>:
<ul>
  <li><b>Target ROI: Radius</b>: As described <a href="#Body tracking cropping">above</a>, set the radius of the square cropped around the body tracking centroid. A preview of the box is shown in the right panel. Select a radius here so that all parts of the animal will always be within the box. APT will only predict parts to be within this box. Selecting a box that is too large will result in lower resolution output predictions.
    <center><a href="images/TargetROIRadius.png"><img src="images/TargetROIRadius.png"></a><br/>
      <i>Preview of Target ROI:Radius parameter</i></center>
  </li>
  <li><b>Target ROI: Align using trajectory theta</b>: As described <a href="#Body tracking cropping">above</a>, decide whether you want to align the square cropped around the body tracking centroid with the tracked body orientation. We recommend doing this when (a) orientation of the animal is accurately tracked and (b) tracking should be invariant to this orientation, i.e. there is no semantic difference between directions in the video. For example, in video recorded from overhead, we want our tracker to work the same for an animal facing up, left, right, or down. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For projects <b>without body tracking</b>, cropping can be modified by selecting <b>"Edit cropping"</b> from the File menu. Here, you can set a <b>single, static crop box for each movie</b>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To create the initial crop box, click <b>"Adjust Size"</b>. This will place a box whose corners you can drag around. </li>
  <li>Click <b>"Done Adjusting"</b> when you have finished adjusting this box.</li>
  <li>The <b>same size box</b> is required for all videos for a given view in a project. Thus, when you switch to a different movie, by default, you can drag around the location of the box, but not change its size. </li>
  <li>To change the size of the crop box, click "Adjust Size". This will <b>change the size of the crop box for all movies</b> for a given view.</li>
  <li>When you are done, click "Finish". The main view will now zoom in to this crop region. </li>
</ul>

  <i>Interface to edit crop region for the current movie</i>
</center>

<h4>2. Set data augmentation parameters</h4>
<p>APT can be trained that tracking should be <b>invariant</b> to certain kinds of perturbations through data augmentation. Here, each training example is randomly perturbed every time it is seen during training. This effectively increases the size of your training set, and allows trackers to be trained from smaller amounts of manual annotation.</p>

</center>

<p>A variety of different types of perturbations are available. You should set the data augmentation parameters so that the perturbations reflect variation you expect to see in videos you want to run your tracker on. For example, if some of your videos are darker than others, you should set the "Brightness range" parameter so that it can transform images from a bright video to look like images in a dark video. APT's data augmentation module performs the following types of perturbations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Rotate range</b>: Augment by rotating training images and labels by a random angle less than this number of degrees in either direction. If you <i>don't</i> have body tracking orientation available, and you want APT to be invariant to heading direction, you should set this to 180 degrees to rotate by any amount. </li>
  <li><b>Translation range</b>: Augment by translating training images and labels by a random amounts in both x- and y- directions less than this number of pixels.</li>
  <li><b>Scale range</b>: Augment by adjusting image scale by a random amount between (1/this number) to (this number). 1 indicates no scale adjustment.</li>
  <li><b>Contrast range</b>: Augment by adjusting image contrast by a random amount less than this number. 0 indicates no contrast adjustment, 1 indicates maximum contrast adjustment</li>
  <li><b>Brightness range</b>: Augment by adjusting image brightness by a random amount less than this number. 0 indicates no brightness adjustment, 1 indicates maximum brightness adjustment.</li>
  <li><b>Flip horizontally</b>: Augment by flipping the training image and labels horizontally (left to right). If you use this, it is important that you set pairs of corresponding landmarks, e.g. the left rear foot part corresponds to the right rear foot part when flipped, by selecting <a href="#FlipLandmarkPairings">"Select landmark flip pairings"</a> from the Track menu. </li>
  <li><b>Flip vertically</b>: Augment by flipping the training image ang labels vertically (top to bottom). If you use this, it is important that you set pairs of corresponding landmarks, e.g. the left rear foot part corresponds to the right rear foot part when flipped, by selecting <a href="#FlipLandmarkPairings">"Select landmark flip pairings"</a> from the Track menu. </li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Set memory-related parameters</h4>

<p>To train a deep neural network, it must fit within your GPU's memory. The amount of memory necessary is proportional to the <b>product</b> of the <b>area of the input image</b> in pixels times the neural network's <b>batch size</b>:
<var>Memory</var> &#8733; <var>Area</var>&#183;<var>BatchSize</var>.
</p>
<p>Next, set the <b>"Downsample factor"</b> and <b>"Training batch size"</b> parameters so that the network will fit into memory.</p>

<center>
<table id="table_align" style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <center><a href="images/DownsampleFactor.png"><img width="100%" src="images/DownsampleFactor.png"/></a></center>
    </td>
    <td>
      <center><a href="images/TrainingBatchSize.png"><img width="100%" src="images/TrainingBatchSize.png"/></a></center>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><center><i>Memory requirements for different <b>Downsample factors</b></i></center></td>
    <td><center><i>Memory requirements for different <b>Training batch sizes</b></i></center></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The area of the input image is computed as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We need to know the <b>area of the cropped image</b>.
    <ul>
      <li>For body-tracking projects, crop area is specified by the <a href="#Target ROI Radius">Target ROI Radius</a>, and the area of the image in pixels is computed as <b><var>Area</var><sub>0</sub> = 4&#183;<var>Radius</var><sup>2</sup></b>.</li>
      <li>For projects without body tracking, cropping can be specified by selecting <b><a href="#Edit cropping">"Edit cropping"</a></b> from the File menu. By default, the cropped region is the entire video frame. The crop area is (<var>Area<sub>0</sub></var> = <var>width</var>&#183;<var>height<var>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If this crop area is large, we can make it smaller by <b>downsampling</b> the image -- shrinking the image in both width and height. This is specified in the <a href="#TrackingParametersGUI">Tracking parameters GUI</a> as <b>Downsample factor</b>. Downsizing the image has the <b>negative effect</b> of <b>throwing away details</b> that may be important to finding parts. It also <b>reduces final resolution of the output</b> tracking. We recommend downsampling as little as possible. The input image area is reduced by this downsample factor squared: <var>Area</var> = <var>DownsampleFactor</var><sup>2</sup>&#183;<var>Area</var><sub>0</sub>. An estimate of the memory required for the current and other Downsample factors is shown in the Parameter visualization window when you select Downsample factor in the Tracking Parameters GUI. </li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>Training batch size</b> is the number of images the neural network processes at a time during training. Memory requirements <b>increase linearly</b> with the batch size. Neural network performance can degrade with either too large or too small batch sizes. We recommend batch sizes in the range of 2 to 8 images. An estimate of the memory required for the current and other batch sizes is shown in the Parameter visualization window when you select Training batch size in the Tracking Parameters GUI. </p>

<h4>4. Set N. iterations of training</h4>

<p>Switch the <a href="#TrackingParametersGUI">Tracking parameters GUI</a> to show "<b>Beginner</b>" parameters. Set "<b>N. iterations of training</b>" in the <a href="#TrackingParametersGUI">Tracking parameters GUI</a>. This is the number of the tracker is trained for, and training time increases linearly with number of iterations. Longer training generally works better, but takes longer and has diminishing returns. During training, you can examine whether training has converged, and decide to stop training at any time.</p>
  
<h4>5. Set landmark flip pairings</h4>

<center><a id="FlipLandmarkPairings" href="images/FlipLandmarkPairings.png"><img src="images/FlipLandmarkPairings.png" width="25%"></a><br/>
<i>Examples of pairs of matching landmarks to swap when flipping during data augmentation. Note that some landmarks are unpaired. These do not need to be swapped.</i></center>
<p>If you selected <b>"Flip horizontally"</b> or <b>"Flip vertically"</b> above, it is important that you <b>specify corresponding pairs</b> of landmarks after this flip occurs. For example, after flipping both the image and the manual annotations, the left rear foot should be where the right rear foot is, and vice-versa. To do this, select <b>"Select landmark flip pairings"</b> from the Track menu.</p>

<p>You can watch training progress in the Training Monitor window.</p>
<p>The top plot shows the <b>Training loss</b> being minimized as a function of number of training iterations on the current training batch. This should generally be decreasing with more iterations of training, but may occasionally waiver, as this is the training loss on only a sample of the training data (the current batch), and because we are using stochastic gradient descent for optimization. If training loss is <b>not</b> decreasing, then something is likely going wrong. If it seems to have plateaued, this could be a sign that training has converged and the tracker will not improve with more iterations of training.</p>
<p>The second plot shows the average Euclidean <b>distance</b> between the current landmark predictions and the manual labels. Again, this should generally trend down with more iterations of training. </p>
<p>The green text shows information about the <b>training status</b>, including whether training is running, how many iterations of training have been complete, and when the monitor was last updated. </p>
<p>The text window shows <b>information about the training jobs</b> that depends on the item selected from the pop-up menu at the bottom:

The most recent tracker can be used any time to track frames by clicking the <a href="#Tracking">Track</a> button. This allows you to preview the tracker's performance without waiting for training to finish.

<p>You can monitor progress in the <b>Tracking Monitor</b>.</p>
<p>The top, blue text shows information about <b>which tracker</b> is being used for tracking.</p>
<p>The colored bar(s) show the number of frames that have been tracked for each movie being tracked.</p>
<p>The green text shows information about tracking progress.</p>
<p>The text window shows <b>information about the tracking jobs</b> that depends on the item selected from the pop-up menu at the bottom:
  <ul>
    <li><b>List all jobs</b>: Provide status of all jobs running. </li>
    <li><b>Show tracking jobs' status</b>: Provide more detailed information about the tracking job(s) started within this APT session. </li>
    <li><b>Update tracking monitor plots</b>: Force an update to the tracking monitor, which is otherwise updated on a timer.</li>
    <li><b>Show log files</b>: Show the contents of the tracking log files. </li>
    <li><b>Show error messages</b>: Show error messages indicating why tracking failed.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>At any time, you can push the <b>Stop tracking</b> button to stop tracking. Stopping tracking requires a sequence of events to happen which could take a few seconds, so please be patient and only press this button once. <b>No</b> intermediate results will be available if tracking is stopped prematurely. </p>

<h2><a id="Exporting manual labels"> Exporting manual labels  </a></h2>

<p>Exporting manual labels to a .trk file:</p>
Select File -> Import/Export -> Export Labels to Trk Files
The first time you do this it will save to the same directory as your movie files, with a filename of [movie file name]_[labeler project name]_labels.trk.  If you go to export again, it will prompt for overwriting, adding datetime or canceling the export.  Note that the _labels part of the filename distinguishes between a trk file of manual labels and a trk file of automatically generated labels.

<h2><a id="Evaluating performance"> Evaluating performance  </a></h2>

There are two ways to evaluate performance in APT: Cross Validation and Ground-Truthing Mode. Both of these options are found under the "Evaluate" tab in the main menu bar.

<h3><a id="Cross validation"> Cross validation  </a></h3>

APT uses k-fold cross validation, in which you train on (k-1)/k of the labels, and test on the held out 1/k labels for a partitioning of the labels into k sets. 

To start Evaluate > Cross validation

THis will pop up a window that prompts for number of k-folds.

When cross validation is done running it will pop up a window with two buttons, "Export Results to Workspace" and "View Results in APT"
<br>

Pressing "Export Results to Workspace" will pop up a window that says "Wrote variable aptXVresults in base workspace", you can then manually save that variable.  Note that to load that variable in later to evaluate it you need to run APT.setpath to set the MovieIndex class.


<p>Structure of the aptXVresults variable:
it is a [number of labeled targets] x 9 cell array, with the following columns:</p>
<ol>
<li> fold is the cross-validation set/fold index.</li>
<li> mov is the movie index (into .movieFilesAll). </li>
<li> frm is the frame. </li>
<li> iTgt is the target index (index into .trx). </li>
<li> tfocc is a [1xnpt] logical, true if pt is occluded. </li>
<li> p is the GT/labeled position vector -- all x coords, then all y coords, so should be [1x2*npts]. </li>
<li> roi is a [1x4] [xlo xhi ylo yhi] for the cropping region when there are trx. xhi-xlo and yhi-ylo are set by Track->Configure tracking parameters->Multiple Targets -> Target crop radius </li>
<li> pTrk is like p, but it is the CPR-tracked position vector. </li>
<li> dGTTrk I think is [1xnpts], euclidean distance from p to pTrk for each pt.</li>
</ol>
[This is saved into the .lbl file now, and there is also a command to delete it]

<h3><a id="Ground-Truthing mode"> Ground-Truthing mode </a></h3>

Ground-Truthing mode enables you to assess the performance of your tracker on an unbiased set of APT-generated test frames.

<p>Create a project, add movies, label frames, and train a tracker iteratively as you normally would in APT.</p>

<p>Select Evaluate>Ground-Truthing Mode. An orange "GT Mode" indicator should appear in the main UI, and the Manage Movies window should appear.</p>

<p>Manage Movies is now tabbed, with the "GT Movie List" tab selected. The project now contains two sets of movies: i) "regular" movies used for training and parameter refinement, and ii) "GT" movies for testing tracker performance.
Add test movies to the GT movie list. If possible, it is best to use movies that are not also in the regular movie list, ie that the project has never seen before.
When the movie list is complete, press the "GT Frames" button to bring up the Ground-Truthing window. The project can be saved at any time during this process. (If you close GT window it can be re-opened from movie manager GUI). </p>

<p>In the Ground-Truthing window, press the Suggest button to generate a new/fresh list of frames to label. At the moment, frames are sampled randomly from the available GT movies, with all frames equally weighted. Other options are available at the command-line (see below).
Click on a row in the table to navigate to a frame, or use the "Next Unlabeled" button. The APT main axes should become highlighted, indicating that the current frame/target is a GT frame. Label this frame. These labels will be used as GT labels against which the tracker will be compared.</p>

<p>When all GT frames are labeled, press "Compute GT Performance". APT will track the GT frames using the trained tracker, and compare the results to the manual GT labels.
Along with various plots, the Labeler property .gtTblRes provides a results table for each GT row: manual labels, tracked positions, and L2 error.</p>

<p>Save the project to preserve your GT movie list, the list of GT frames with their labels, and the GT results.</p>

<h2><a id="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

<h4>I'm a Janelian and when testing the <a href="LocalBackEnd.html#DockerLocalBackEnd">Docker</a> backend, I get the following permission error:</h4>
  <code>docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.35/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.See 'docker run --help'.</code>

<ol>
  <li>From the command line, check that root is the owner of <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>:
    <pre>$ ls -hl /var/run/docker.sock</pre>
    The output will look like:
    <pre>srw-rw---- 1 root root 0 Feb 27 17:21 /var/run/docker.sock=</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Change the owner of <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code> to yourself:
    <pre>$ sudo chown bransonk /var/run/docker.sock</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Start the docker daemon:
    <pre>$ sudo dockerd &</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
