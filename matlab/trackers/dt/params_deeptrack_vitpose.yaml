# * Each node has a list of metadata:
# - 1 - pretty name (displayed). Note, the node name/identifier itself is also
#                                meaningful as the fieldname in the data struct. 
# - 2 - type (see PropertiesGUIProp.m for options)
# - 3 - isEditable
# - 4 - description
# - 5 - default value
# - 6 - visualization function
# - 7 - level - one of {'Important','Beginner','Advanced','Developer'}.
#               All important features need to be reset for each
#               project. Default values should work for all
#               non-Important features, but better results could
#               potentially be achieved by changing these. The rest of
#               the parameters are split into those that often are
#               helpful to adjust (Beginner), those that should be
#               rarely adjusted (Intermediate), and those that only
#               someone working with a developer should touch. This
#               property is only used for leaf nodes. Level of
#               non-leaf nodes is based on maximum level of children,
#               with important being highest, developer being lowest.
# - 8 - requirements - some parameters will only be used in certain kinds of projects.
#                      list here keys for including these
#                      parameters. Non-leaf nodes included if any
#                      child node is included.
# * After the metadata comes a list of child nodes.
# * As a shortcut, leaf nodes can contain the metadata directly as their value.
